# Apartment Clustering

this dataset is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunhee/koreahousedata). we do clustering for it, so we can find the apartment group.

by the elbow method. we got the optimal number cluster. and the optimal number is 3. we will devide the apartment to 3 cluster. and find the identity of each cluster.

check the [Apartment Clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/Mcx002/apartment-clustering/blob/master/Apartment%20Clustering.ipynb) file to see how it's work.
